# How to collaborate #

## Carbon models ##

Our favorite place for developer collaboration involves improving our [carbon models](http://carbon.brighterplanet.com/models). Choose the model you'd like to help us with and use the "source code" link from its page to access and clone the model's git repository from GitHub. We can't accept any improvements that don't include associated tests, so please TDD! In order to add to and run the model's testsuite, you'll need to use the [`sniff`](http://github.com/brighterplanet/sniff) development environment---check out its [README](http://github.com/brighterplanet/sniff#readme) for details and a complete outline of the collaboration cycle.

## Other software ##

We also welcome patches for our [other open source projects](/projects.html) using the standard GitHub fork-and-pull-request process.
