## Ideas for things we'd love to support

* A carbon calculation plugin for Google's Power Meter program
* An excellent Ruby 1.9 quantities (numbers with units) library
* A mirror of the EPA's U.S. Greenhouse Gas Inventory in some kind of more open, useful format
* Carbon calcs on Google Maps
* A significant-digits management library for Ruby
* Initial development on a carbon model we haven't made yet
* A programmable data-extraction tool for PDFs
* [TripIt itinerary carbon footprints]{.strike}
* CM1 library in a non-Ruby language (e.g. Python, Java)

# Brighter Planet developer fellowship program #

Application deadline
: Rolling

Sponsorship amount
: Typically $1,000--$3,000

Eligible parties
: Individual developers, informal teams, established organizations

To apply
: Describe your project in whatever way works best (text, links, code, etc.) in an email to fellowship@brighterplanet.com.

From our primary language ([Ruby](http://ruby-lang.org)) to our application framework ([Rails](http://rubyonrails.org)) to our toolset ([vagrant](http://vagrantup.com), [rvm](http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/), [bundler](http://gembundler.com/), etc.), Brighter Planet's technology platform makes extensive use of truly irreplaceable open source software packages. It's important to us to give back to the community. The first way we do this is by contributing our own [open source projects](/projects.html) to the commons. The second way takes a cue from Engine Yard's [Community Grant program](http://www.engineyard.com/blog/2010/mitchell-hashimoto-joins-engine-yard-oss-community-grant-program/): we sponsor developers of important tools in order to accelerate and intensify their development.

## Developer fellows ##

*  ### The Oroeco Team <span>What you buy makes a difference</span> ###

   **About Oroeco**  Based out of San Francisco, [Oroeco](http://oroeco.com) is working on helping folks track their personal impact based on what they purchase. The team is developing a web application that dynamically links personalized consumer spending data to social and environmental lifecycle assessment data.

   **Follow along** at Brighter Planet's blog [Safety in Numbers](http://numbers.brighterplanet.com), where Oroeco will be writing about their progress.
   
*  ### Matt Colyer <span>smartermeter: Liberating PG&amp;E energy use data</span> ###

   **About Matt** [Matt Colyer](http://matt.colyer.name) is a developer with a passion to understand how things work. This has led him to be interested in a wide variety of things including making the [iPhone work on Linux](http://www.libimobiledevice.org/), creating [a USB receiver for the Black and Decker Energy Meter](http://matt.colyer.name/projects/power-meter/) and retrieving smart meter data from PG&E using [`smartermeter`](https://github.com/mcolyer/smartermeter). When he's not at a computer, he enjoys riding his rebuilt fixed gear bike or backpacking in one of California's many parks.
   
   **About `smartermeter`** `smartermeter`, currently on version 0.2.1, is primarily a Ruby library for accessing (scraping) PG&amp;E energy use data. Future plans include carbon calculations by CM1 and a UI for PG&amp;E customers. 
   
   **Follow along** at [Matt's blog](http://matt.colyer.name), where he'll be writing about his ongoing experience with `smartermeter`.
*  ### Scott Bulua <span>TripCarbon: Carbon footprints of TripIt itineraries</span> ###

   **About Scott** [Scott](http://twitter.com/#!/iamscott)'s an old hand at both climate and computers, having led the climate campaign at Middlebury College which later became the Sunday Night Group---the foundation for the globally successful [350.org](http://350.org) campaign---and having served as a developer at both [EchoDitto](http://echoditto.com) and our favorite media conglomerate [GOOD](http://good.is).
   
   **About TripCarbon** As an early beta user of the awesome [TripIt](http://tripit.com) travel-itinerary-tracking app, Scott's been itching to bring his climate interest to the travel space with a plugin that calculates the carbon footprint of entire trips.
   
   **Follow along** at Brighter Planet's blog [Safety in Numbers](http://numbers.brighterplanet.com), where Scott will be writing about his experience.
