## Ideas for things we'd love to support

* A carbon calculation plugin for Google's Power Meter program
* An excellent Ruby 1.9 quantities (numbers with units) library
* A mirror of the EPA's U.S. Greenhouse Gas Inventory in some kind of more open, useful format
* Carbon calcs on Google Maps
* A significant-digits management library for Ruby
* Initial development on a carbon model we haven't made yet
* A programmable data-extraction tool for PDFs
* [TripIt itinerary carbon footprints]{.strike}

# Brighter Planet developer fellowship program #

Application deadline
: Rolling

Sponsorship amount
: Typically $1,000--$3,000 (other amounts considered for larger projects)

Eligible parties
: Individual developers, informal teams, established organizations

Qualifications
: Fellowship projects should 1) make Brighter Planet customers' lives easier and 2) benefit the greater open source community

From our primary language ([Ruby](http://ruby-lang.org)) to our application framework ([Rails](http://rubyonrails.org)) to our toolset ([vagrant](http://vagrantup.com), [rvm](http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/), [bundler](http://gembundler.com/), etc.), Brighter Planet's technology platform makes extensive use of truly irreplaceable open source software packages. It's important to us to give back to the community. The first way we do this is by contributing our own [open source projects](/projects.html) to the commons. The second way takes a cue from Engine Yard's [Community Grant program](http://www.engineyard.com/blog/2010/mitchell-hashimoto-joins-engine-yard-oss-community-grant-program/): we sponsor developers of important tools in order to accelerate and intensify their development.

*  ### Scott Bulua <span>TripCarbon: Carbon footprints of TripIt itineraries</span> ###

   **About Scott** [Scott](http://twitter.com/#!/iamscott)'s an old hand at both climate and computers, having led the climate campaign at Middlebury College which later became the Sunday Night Group---the foundation for the globally successful [350.org](http://350.org) campaign---and having served as a developer at both [EchoDitto](http://echoditto.com) and our favorite media conglomerate [GOOD](http://good.is).
   
   **About TripCarbon** As an early beta user of the awesome [TripIt](http://tripit.com) travel-itinerary-tracking app, Scott's been itching to bring his climate interest to the travel space with a plugin that calculates the carbon footprint of entire trips.
   
   **Follow along** at Brighter Planet's blog [Safety in Numbers](http://numbers.brighterplanet.com), where Scott will be writing about his experience.
